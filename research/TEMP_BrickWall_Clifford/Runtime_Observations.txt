On my laptop, with youtube, teams ect running, it takes on average 4-5 seconds to do 1 magic value (M_2) calculation for a
N = 9 qubit system, with D = 45 depth and N_T = 1 T-gates. 

The same calculation on the Nokia cluster (with 100-400% CPU usage and 0.01% RAM usage) it takes on average 8-9 seconds for
the same task with the same parameters
